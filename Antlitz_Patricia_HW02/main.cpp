Purpose: <To read a file by searching for the word "dislike". Then replacing the word for "like">
Sources of Help: <String declaration: https://syntaxdb.com/ref/cpp/string-var . File search and replacement: https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-replace-modify-a-particular-string-in-a-file-using-c++ , https://codeforwin.org/c-programming/c-program-find-and-replace-a-word-in-file . I don't remember learning anything specific about replacing data from a file, so I had to look it up online because I had no idea what the syntax was, above what was learned in class and the hint you gave in the instructions if(word == dislike...). I found an example to which I based my code: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37931691/replace-a-word-in-text-file-using-c>
Time Spent: <1hr - not sure honestly, but I think it was 1 hr more or less>
